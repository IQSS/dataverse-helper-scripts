Capability/Process|API/JSON/Template (server or browser based)|Primefaces Component|Note
**Dev Time**|**Medium**|**High**|
**Automated Testing** (Rest Assured)|**Yes**|**No**
**HTML Customization**|**Easy/Medium**\*|**Difficult**\*\*|\*Many tools available or raw HTML (Java templating, jquery, datatables, angular, react, etc, etc)  \*\*Design limited to Primeface components. (ref: dataset page file listing)
**Troubleshooting**: Business Logic/Design Separate|**Yes**\*|**No**|\*Easier to identify issues, especially with automated testing of business logic.  Right away "50% easier" -- easily determine whether issue is in business logic or template
**Performance Tuning**|More choices/Business logic not in component|Often constrained by component|
**Code reuse**|**High**\*|**Low/Medium**\*\*|\*API endpoints/templates can be re-used. \*\*Components tightly tied to Business Logic
Javascript Dependent|**Yes** - if browser based|**Yes**
508 Compliance with Forms|**It depends**|**No**
