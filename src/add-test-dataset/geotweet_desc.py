def get_geotweet_description():
    desc = """<p><b>Welcome to the Billion Streaming Geotweets API.</b>  This platform, accessible from within Dataverse, will support interactive query, visualization, and subsetting against a billion geo-tweets.</p>

<p>Geotweets are tweets which contain a GPS coordinate generated by the device tweeted from.  Currently about 2% of all tweets are geotweets and there are about 8 million new geotweets created per day. The CGA has been harvesting geotweets since October 2012 and has harvested about 8 billion to date.  In one day 7-8 million "geotweets" (tweets containing GPS coordinates from the originating device) become public.</p>

<p>For social scientists, one promise of streaming spatial data is the possibility to visualize patterns in what people are discussing in time and space, and perhaps examine the recent past for correlations with known events and with other data sources.</p>

<p>There is currently no general purpose solution to support interactive and robust text search and geospatial visualizations of results against datasets containing more than a few million features.</p>

<p>Such a platform, in addition to providing methods for visualizing change over time, should support real-time updates to its data store and should  make it easy to overlay traditional spatial data layers (political boundaries, population data, ethnographic information, land use, etc.) with big data in ways that support qualitative and quantitative analysis.   The architecture for such a system should be highly scalable and support distributed searches across systems maintained by different organizations.</p>

<p>To begin to address the problem, the CGA is building an open source platform to support search and visualization against a billion spatio-temporal features.  The system will run on commodity hardware and well known software.  It will support queries by time, space, keyword, user name, and operating system.  The core platform will be built around Lucene Spatial (<a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">https://lucene.apache.org/</a>) and exposed via a Solr (<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">http://lucene.apache.org/solr/</a>) API.  A mapping client will be developed around OpenLayers (<a href="http://openlayers.org/">http://openlayers.org/</a>  and will be loosely integrated within WorldMap <a href="http://worldmap.harvard.edu">http://worldmap.harvard.edu</a> such that any local or remote GIS layer in WorldMap can be brought into the map client and overlaid with the big data.</p>"""
